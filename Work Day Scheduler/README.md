# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
created an assets folder and within the assets folder i created css and js folders for better organization
did not alter css starting code
added to the html starter code
created a js code
created a work scheduler that checks the current date and displays time in hour intervals from 9AM-5PM
checks whether the hour is past, present or future
allows you to enter text and save the text so even if you leave and refresh the webpage the text remains unless you overwrite it
